need new iproute2:

git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shemminger/iproute2.git
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install

To compile user_xdp* progs (it was in the comments...duh):

gcc -I ../lib/ ../lib/libbpf.o user_xdp10.c -o xdp10


problem: after unloading xdp, interface stops responding to pings -- maybe
I did something weird? Seems to be ok now.

if modifying IP packet at all, need to update checksum or else host stack
will complain.
